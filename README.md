## Description
The application uses the following guidelines to evaluate input:
* For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
* For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
* For a scalene triangle, none of the sides are equal. However, the sum of any
two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
* Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or
less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those
values. (For example, the values 9, 4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.)
